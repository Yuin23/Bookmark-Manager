##	Bookmark manager	##


##### Task:	#####
This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose you to the following aspects of web development, in addition to what we've studied before:

	Integration testing: Capybara and maybe Cucumber 
	Relational databases 
	Security considerations 


##### Description:	#####
A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.


##### The website will have the following features:	#####

	- Show a list of links from the database
	- Add new links
	- Add tags to the links
	- Filter links by a tag
